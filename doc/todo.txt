X create a key listener class and print out key presses
X create a player class
X create an entity class which tracks position
X create a player class which renders a square and can move around using the key presses
===================
X Implement viewport scrolling
X Implement AnimatedSprite class
X create or find some tools:
    X sprite design -> png
X Load tilesets from binary file sprite sheets
    X create binary loader function
    X use binary loader in TileMap, TileSet, Tile, Sprite
    X verify file sizes?
        fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END); // seek to end of file
        size = ftell(f); // get current file pointer
        fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET); // seek back to beginning of file
        // proceed with allocating memory and reading the file

- Windows process priority
- Game menus
- improve tilemap editor controls
    right click to copy tile ID
    open menu to select tiles
    hotkeys for tiles
X save tilemap, keep track of the filename?
- reverse masks for player keys
- player and enemies
- health and damage
- load sprites once and reuse data, maybe make DataLoader logic in BufferIO
    - register the file data to UID hash from string filename
    - loader functions will reuse cached data if possible
    - support optional garbage collection?
    - LoadTileMap
    - SaveTileMap
    - LoadSprite
    - LoadSpriteSheet
- handle game object deletion and deregister from game
==================
- 8bit sprite color palette? format sprites in indexed colors
- physics engine research
- sorting alg
- recursive collision detection and resolution
- Vector2 operator overload (* + -)
- reorganize folder structure
- performance counters (FPS, CPU/RAM/VRAM usage)
