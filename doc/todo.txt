===================
X Implement viewport scrolling
X Implement AnimatedSprite class
X create or find some tools:
    X sprite design -> png
X Load tilesets from binary file sprite sheets
    X create binary loader function
    X use binary loader in TileMap, TileSet, Tile, Sprite
    X verify file sizes?
        fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END); // seek to end of file
        size = ftell(f); // get current file pointer
        fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET); // seek back to beginning of file
        // proceed with allocating memory and reading the file
