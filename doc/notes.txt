Game:
  does all the main driver stuff:
    create and init game objects
    register game objects to the renderer
    update the game objects
    process the game loop at FPS rate

Renderer:
   create and init the SDL window
   keep a list of game objects
   render function should render map tiles and all game objects
   map object and game objects should decide what needs to be rendered and where
   renderer just calls the function
